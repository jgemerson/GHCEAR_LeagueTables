# Global Health CEA Registry Search Function and League Tables Shiny App

## Background
The [Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (GH CEA) Registry](http://healtheconomics.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/orchard) is a database of all English-language cost-per-DALY averted cost-utility analyses published from 1995 to present. The GH CEA Registry is maintained and updated by Tufts Medical Center's [Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health (CEVR)](http://cevr.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/) and funded by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/).

This R Shiny App serves as a front-end search feature for the database, as well as League Table analytic tool to help researchers and policymakers access evidence for cost-effective health interventions primarily focusing on low- and middle-income (LMIC) settings.
